After each bounce, the height it rebounds to decreases by 10%, i.e. after one bounce, it reaches `0.9*h_0`, after two bounces it reaches `0.9*0.9*h_0`, etc. Write a Python function `compute_heights` that returns a list of the maximum heights of the ball after each bounce (including after 0 bounces, i.e. its initial height), until either the ball has bounced `n` times *or* its maximum height falls below `h1`.
